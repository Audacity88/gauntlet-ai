## Notes

- All ID fields are now UUIDs
- Profile ID is required in many operations
- Message content field replaces message field in DMs
- Message field replaces content field in channels
- Timestamps use inserted_at consistently across all tables
- RLS policies need careful updates
- Consider adding migration path for existing data if needed
