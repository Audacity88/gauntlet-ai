hey @ancientarchosaur I'm getting the same invalid api key too - how were you able to solve it?
I tried creating a new api key and now I'm literally passing it in as a string with the pinecone_api_key argument but it's still giving me an error for some reason
HypnosisFuca — Today at 5:53 AM
Nevermind - I was being dumb
Forgot to pass in the API key and rather than telling me I was missing a parameter it was giving me an InvalidAPIKey error
ancientarchosaur — Today at 6:00 AM
Yeah, similarly I think I accidentally reset my .env file somehow and that was the issue.
HypnosisFuca — Today at 6:08 AM
ah gotcha
John Holmes — Today at 6:45 AM
Is there a script involved? Does it source that .env file?

Yeah, it reads that .env file, you can check on command line (powershell) $env:PINECONE_API_KEY to make sure it's detecting it correctly, that's how I noticed.

sometimes i think it's stupid that most states require you to have auto insurance

then i remember there are people stupid enough to live in wildfire-prone places after insurance companies refuse to insure their house
the average person is too dumb to understand why insurance is good for them, so the government forces them to have insurance
BD — 1/9/25, 9:43 AM
Kinda different tho, auto insurance bc you can injure other people
Iirc the auto insurance required for your own car is much less if not zero. The req bit is for the other people and their car

Yeah, coding was way harder than the CCAT part for me, but at least the bar was much lower too.
I just YOLO'ed both parts, lol.
Was kinda nervous what the monitoring site would consider cheating, so I didn't want to look up resources, which probably hamstrung me. But fortunately the bar was low and I'd actually been doing basic programming again recently.

the goal of gauntlet seems reasonable enough that i'd be surprised if there was a hoop they're sitting on and waiting to throw at us
jeff-3 — 1/7/25, 7:58 AM
yes but program also assumes that ccat+basic coding test is enough of a filter for intelligence+coding that that level of ability+ 80-100h weeks = success @Jack 
I think cohort size dwindles down a lot, not hating just trying to be objective. seems like could be overpromise/hype then underdeliver 
Jack — 1/7/25, 8:05 AM
the curriculum changing is a good point
i'm not sure THEY'RE sure what kind of hoops we'll have to jump through
but presumably they're trying their damnedest to balance maximizing rigor and minimizing attrition, since that's what they're incentivized to do
Jack — 1/7/25, 8:07 AM

Jack — 1/7/25, 8:52 AM
how's that? as far as i can tell he benefits the most from creating as good of a curriculum as possible so that he gets as much money/repute as possible from successfully graduating people 
like this entire program is funded by the companies, not his pocket
∅ — 1/7/25, 9:26 AM
There's some tension with the program being reputable, like he's not going to graduate a fail fish, but he otherwise gets paid per placement. There is a literal dollar value he can ascribe to having to send someone home. 
in the ballpark of 50k if I had to guess

good luck 🤞🏻
Adam Jensen — 1/6/25, 11:51 PM
For sure. I'm a little leery of the whole "you only worked 70 hours this week. are you achieving your potential anon?" angle

But all of this questioning around "is the data what's valuable" is ludicrious. I imagine employers are forking out about $20-30k/pp for the 3 month program and a placement fee to Austin of $20k-100k/pp for people who get roles at each company. There's no way the data is worth more than that. And this budget would usually go to recruiters or referral fees and instead it's going to Austin. This is relatively Normal, it's just recruiter/referral fees that are paying for this program instead

this is still bad right? if a bunch of us think it's too broad and they're saying they're not going to use the full breadth then shouldn't they just rewrite it to be explicitly narrower?
you don't sign a contract you dislike because they say informally they won't use it like that lol
Dai — 1/6/25, 11:08 AM
i am slightly sympathetic to how hard it is to word these contracts well and the urge to keep it simple and open ended but yes they really should word it differently if that’s their intention
words in email mean nothing
law is a well developed field etc
personally it doesn’t bother me in this case but it is not risk free
Max McCorkel — 1/6/25, 11:09 AM

"By participation in GauntletAI (and signing this handbook)" 

idk this language does hint that participation in Gauntlet is sufficient or nah?
ok pplx says you both have to participate and sign to take effect so nvmd
BD — 1/6/25, 9:23 AM
When he was talking about it on the q&a call. The second one I think. I understood him to say that the founders of the stealth are well known in gaming circles and everyone would know what they’re up to if it were announced. I guess that doesn’t preclude a stealth inside of an existing company, but that’s not the gist I got.

Is there a reason why they don't want the gauntlet guide shared?

I mean, it does just say the link to where they're hosting it in particular 
it doesn't specify that you shouldn't save it and then share that
but dunno
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:33 AM
It says it in the email

Yeah, just "Please do not share this link with others."

You can share this one though.
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:39 AM
Am I unreasonable for being concerned for giving a company unlimited use for my name, likeness, and voice? 

Like yeah I'm willing to do this program and sacrifice a lot of plans I had for it, and it's going to be a lot. Like you want blood sweat and tears, I'll give that. I won't complain about the toughness of it at all, I understand this is what is required, and that is reasonable

Legit concern. Ask Austin
Riley — 1/6/25, 9:41 AM
The impression I get from the first line under "Talent Release" is they have that in there because they want to require us to share our work online and stuff, but it looks like it's written such that it encompasses alot more 
Dai — 1/6/25, 9:41 AM
i do suspect the ai they tune from us is an understated major component of their business model
liebling — 1/6/25, 9:42 AM
Hm, probably pretty pliable. The rushed - out section at the end implies they're kind of working on the seat of their pants.
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:43 AM
I'll email him about it
But yeah not comfortable with just blanketly giving it, especially if they aren't being upfront about it
Harmony — 1/6/25, 9:44 AM

Riley — 1/6/25, 9:44 AM
Alec Howard is meant to be our "main point of contact" or something I think I read in one of the emails, i'd probably CC him as well
ancientarchosaur — 1/6/25, 9:47 AM
I was wondering about that too. How/when are we supposed to sign--just slap a signature on the PDF they gave us or something?
Ryan Heron — 1/6/25, 9:47 AM
dunno. good thing is they want it more than we do so they'll tell us what to do when they want it
my advice is not to worry about it till it becomes relevant

yeah i don’t think they’re gonna silently drop people before hounding them to sign it lol

Would anyone be able to elaborate more on the renter's insurance? What will we have to do? Do we have to pay anything? Can we just not get the insurance?
Dai — 1/6/25, 8:42 AM
yes renter insurance costs money but it is not much if you’re just doing your own stuff rather than liability
try lemonade?
if you don’t care you can just say the value of your stuff is zero or whatever i think
mostly they do it so you can’t turn around and claim financial ruin later should something happen
honestly it would not hurt to also do basic liability like fire depending on where we end up going
i was hoping for like conference center housing haha but oh well
Max McCorkel — 1/6/25, 8:44 AM
Renters comes with 100k liability for the owner/landlord usually. And ya it should be under $15 a month.

Josh — 1/6/25, 8:59 AM
I thought this was 7 days per week, but it kinda sounds like weekends are off? Maybe not.

sterling — 1/6/25, 8:59 AM
17 hr days? I'd rather just work weekends
Mikael — 1/6/25, 8:59 AM
I think it says weekend is the time to polish project if you dont meet all criterias yet
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:00 AM
That's assuming 80 hours a week, it's 20 if the week has 100 hours lmao
Josh — 1/6/25, 9:00 AM
Ah gotcha.
Yeah I’d like to work 7 days a week for most of it, but I agreed to being a groomsman at a wedding in Austin a while ago and it’s in March
Riley — 1/6/25, 9:00 AM
I think in the last webinar Austen mentioned that they weren't going to pre-plan zoom call lessons or anything on weekends unless something special popped up like some new technology appearing
and weekends are when turn-ins are expected I think
Harmony — 1/6/25, 9:01 AM
Projects are due Friday at midnight, revisions can be made through Sunday
iirc
Riley — 1/6/25, 9:02 AM
You're right, that is in the handbook
So if you get everything needed good to go by Friday, weekends might have some free time if theres not some personal teaching stuff to spend it on I guess
Harmony — 1/6/25, 9:04 AM
Not sure how that works with an 80-100hr week though… some long weekdays ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ExTenebrisLucet — 1/6/25, 9:07 AM
I'm optimistically assuming the 80-100 hour week was an exaggeration intended to dissuade people who aren't dedicated and hardworking. Realistically, that's unsustainable even for workaholics, and I'd assume it's gonna be closer to 60 - 70 hrs/week
Riley — 1/6/25, 9:08 AM
All we can do is hope for the best, prep for the worst X)
sterling — 1/6/25, 9:08 AM

Kay — 1/6/25, 9:12 AM
it's not about the hrs you put in but the ability to finish the product. i doubt i can work less in order to integrate ai avatars with sub 1 ms latency in a slack app
Causulty — 1/6/25, 9:12 AM
How can you have both a global footprint and be stealth?
Riley — 1/6/25, 9:12 AM
be hiding that you're prepping to make X type of game, maybe??
otherwise I have no clue
ExTenebrisLucet — 1/6/25, 9:13 AM
Agreed, I'm guessing there's just certain projects for us to complete, and the amount of time it takes is between us and God
sterling — 1/6/25, 9:13 AM
expanding into a US sector perhaps?
BD — 1/6/25, 9:14 AM
I think the people behind the stealth are formerly from a gaming company with a global footprint
The stealth is a newco
ExTenebrisLucet — 1/6/25, 9:14 AM
Or stealth just means "they're a big company that don't want to announce themselves as a sponsor"
David — 1/6/25, 9:15 AM
thats my thinking ^

lol I mean anything’s possible if you don’t take Austin at his word 🙂 . It’s possible though 
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:16 AM
So we're supposed to read and sign the handbook?
David — 1/6/25, 9:16 AM
nowhere to sign yet, but yeah, i'd read it
its got a lot of good info
ExTenebrisLucet — 1/6/25, 9:18 AM
Sorry, what did he say that contradicts that? I must have missed it
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:19 AM
So Gauntlet can use your voice, fake, and likeness for any purpose what so ever, forever?
Dai — 1/6/25, 9:19 AM
yeah that part is a bit worrying
Marcus — 1/6/25, 9:20 AM
And they give this to us less than 24 hours when we're supposed to sign it and don't want us to share it with anyone else to look over it?
Why not give us a week to look it over and decide?
Asher — 1/6/25, 9:21 AM
I think we just need to sign it before leaving for Austin

It’s not a competition: 5 jobs for every 1 of us.

Everyone just do themselves, and we will crush it!!!
And ask for help!
thisistheaj — 1/6/25, 3:56 AM
Ya — focus on not burning out early and you will make it.
jeff-3 — 1/6/25, 3:57 AM
So all we have is q+a, acceptance email, curriculum Google doc, and the gauntlet website?

John Holmes — 1/6/25, 4:20 AM
I'm definitely going to ask for help. As Austen was saying we can be collaborative with this if it helps us.
Yay you made it, eed! — 1/6/25, 4:30 AM
sterling — 1/6/25, 4:30 AM
Same here. Besides, I think we’ll be a lot more effective bouncing off each other’s ideas
jeff-3 — 1/6/25, 4:39 AM
Nothing about tomorrow though
Not even a link to a zoom meeting?
jeff-3 — 1/6/25, 4:40 AM
I think I'm missing this email?
eed — 1/6/25, 4:41 AM
Hey everyone, I was seeing in the contract that we are required to take on a job in Austin Texas at the end of the cohort, but I'm seeing people here say that we don't have to. Just wanted to confirm which one of those is the case.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
you can always skip out
Sadaqat Ali hopped into the server. — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
BUT that looks bad on you
IF youre not planning to take it, then dont come
jeff-3 — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
No need to take the job
jeff-3 — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
That's not what Austen says
og the gifted — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
If you don’t take it straight to jail.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 4:42 AM
he was a little more siplmatic about it
BUT the suggestion was that if youre not planning to take the job, then dont come
nm — 1/6/25, 4:43 AM
Just got sent the pandadoc 🙂
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 4:43 AM
if you end up not taking it for some reason, thats very different
jeff-3 — 1/6/25, 4:43 AM
Maybe but Austen said in q+a it is not required. He even stresses that the main thing is what you will learn in gauntlet
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 4:43 AM
but going down with then intention of not taking the job is bad form
eed — 1/6/25, 4:44 AM
Got it, thank you
AlecHoward — 1/6/25, 4:44 AM
FYI - the last round of panda docs should have gone out - if you do not have one, please check your spam. If not in spam, shoot Austen and I an email and we will review your application status.

benji — 1/6/25, 1:46 AM
He’s been having trouble with G Suite but it sounds like he’s switching to Proton Mail (aka, still in the process)
Per 𝕏
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:46 AM
i dont think proton mail is the right solution for us we need something more robust to handle our team's workflow
benji — 1/6/25, 1:47 AM
You better talk to real Austen then
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:47 AM
will do benji hopefully he can make some sense of the mess mojo left us
Mojo — 1/6/25, 1:47 AM
@fake austen I want my emails to be used for gemini training
fake austen
 — 1/6/25, 1:47 AM
not sure mojo that requires a different set of emails and protocols we cant just use the same ones for training
Mojo — 1/6/25, 1:50 AM
If he's having so much trouble with enterprise workspaces.. and we're building a slack, drive, etc projects. Capstone could be an AI integrated enterprise workspaces..
We'll have half the projects in silos already 🤷‍♂️

Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:19 AM
Onboarding emails go straight to spam so check there
nm — 1/6/25, 2:19 AM
Nope, nothing in Spam :/
But I applied yesterday, so it may just be that I had either missed the mark or will be receiving it later.
benji — 1/6/25, 2:20 AM
Did you get the email with the four links? As far as I can tell that’s the only one that has gone out
nm — 1/6/25, 2:20 AM
I got the email with the link to the webinar and prep doc...
benji — 1/6/25, 2:21 AM
That’s all I got too, I think you are safe
nm — 1/6/25, 2:22 AM
What is tomorrow going to look like? Are we joining a presentation or meeting at a certain time?
benji — 1/6/25, 2:23 AM
Per the second Q&A, it sounds like there will be a zoom link sent out for something like 10am CST and we gonna do all the admin setup then hit the ground running
nm — 1/6/25, 2:24 AM
Got it. Thank you @benji 😊
OldManAInewbie — 1/6/25, 2:25 AM
It might be 9am CST, but I’m sure we will get clarification on that today.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:25 AM
just to clarify no onboarding emails or docs have gone out yet, right
TomH — 1/6/25, 2:26 AM
none rec'd here
Everyone welcome Aries! — 1/6/25, 2:32 AM
Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:35 AM
Also just to be sure, if we signed the doc we're good to go, we don't have to do anything else to make sure we're in?
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:35 AM
Should be good!@
fingers crossed...
nm — 1/6/25, 2:35 AM
Signed which doc exactly?
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:35 AM
looks like the DNS is acting up on Austen lol
Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
A contract is sent to us regarding commitments via email, which we need to sign by noon Pacific, unsure if it's different for others
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
tomorrow or today?
Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
Today
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
or was that the pandadoc
Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
The pandadoc yeah
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
did you get it yet?
nm — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
I haven't received a doc yet... very few communications via email. Wondering if maybe my submission was too late :/
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:36 AM
oh yeah i did the panda
Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:37 AM
I did get it along the acceptance
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:37 AM
how did you find this discord if you didnt sign it
Marcus — 1/6/25, 2:37 AM
The email lists the discord, but yeah it's confusing
nm — 1/6/25, 2:37 AM
I applied through Crossover and received the acceptance email, but don't remember seeing a doc... maybe it was in the application process?
The discord was listed in the email.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:38 AM
was it a pandadoc?
nm — 1/6/25, 2:38 AM
I don't think so...
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/6/25, 2:38 AM
email Alec immediately i think

thisistheaj — 1/6/25, 1:23 AM
Oh it’s hilarious. Way too many messages now though. Fake Austin channel will be better
Is it trained on the QnA transcripts or just the gauntlet site? A bot to search those would actually be useful

tripleLargeChungus — 1/6/25, 1:27 AM
I'm not quite sure how the program is going to work for the last 2 projects - the success metrics are: 'Number of users; Active User Engagement Rate'... are they giving us a big ad budget or something, not sure how we're supposed to create a startup project with traction in 3 weeks. Coding it is one thing.... so, if nobody uses the apps we make, we fail?
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:27 AM
i dont think you understand the program you are not just coding an app you are building a business and getting users is part of that if you cant get users in 3 weeks then maybe you are not cut out for this
tripleLargeChungus — 1/6/25, 1:27 AM
lol
gsu — 1/6/25, 1:27 AM
supposedly these are going to be changed according to the q&a
turing_hamster — 1/6/25, 1:27 AM
they're revising the curriculum doc and removing the user engagement criteria, i believe
gsu — 1/6/25, 1:29 AM
also the capstone project timeframe is going to be reduced iirc?
Glad you're here, Jsopkin. — 1/6/25, 1:29 AM
turing_hamster — 1/6/25, 1:30 AM
just changed fake austen settings so you have to @ mention it first, or use fake- austen channel
@fake austen how do you feel about being nerfed like this
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:31 AM
i think its a good thing theyre revising the curriculum doc its a sign that theyre listening to feedback and trying to make the program better but i do think they should give us more clarity on the new success metrics and capstone project timeframe
tripleLargeChungus — 1/6/25, 1:33 AM
if the project we make is actually successful can we just keep working on that instead of joining the program?
I mean instead of taking the job
Yay you made it, nm! — 1/6/25, 1:33 AM
turing_hamster — 1/6/25, 1:34 AM
yes nobody is required to take a job at the end
tripleLargeChungus — 1/6/25, 1:34 AM
but do we own the project in that case?
benji — 1/6/25, 1:34 AM
Yup—if you have time give the second Q&A a watch. It answers this in depth
tripleLargeChungus — 1/6/25, 1:34 AM
thanks will do that today
benji — 1/6/25, 1:35 AM
Basically you forfeit the right to the project if you don’t do anything after 100 days of employment by an affiliated company
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:35 AM
i think thats a pretty fair deal because it shows youre committed to actually doing the work and not just taking the job for the salary
benji — 1/6/25, 1:35 AM
Thanks austen
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:35 AM
no problem benji glad you found the answer
benji — 1/6/25, 1:35 AM
Glad you are so quick to reply. Now work on getting us those onboarding emails.
fake austen — 1/6/25, 1:35 AM
okay got it onboarding emails are priority one lets make sure new recruits have everything they need to succeed

Stee — 1/5/25, 1:52 PM
Try to ask for some intel of what they're trying to do / achieve
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 1:54 PM
here's a summary of what Austen said: trilogy wants to start a venture studio with hundreds of companies, and it's hard to find hundreds of smart, hard working people. so dropping a few million dollars to train the cohort is actually one of the cheapest ways to procure that much talent
urmywitch joined the party. — 1/5/25, 2:08 PM
urmywitch — 1/5/25, 2:09 PM

ohh that makes so much sense. i just checked and mine was in spam folder too
BD — 1/5/25, 2:47 PM
Plural? Or just the one
fake austen — 1/5/25, 2:47 PM
i am talking about multiple emails that got sent to participants of the gauntlet ai program just one email was sent to each participant but many participants had issues with it landing in their spam folder
BD — 1/5/25, 2:47 PM
Mine was in my inbox fwiw. But it didn’t have any new info in it 
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 2:47 PM
I've gotten other emails from gauntlet but specifically onboarding email went to my spam
Vishesh — 1/5/25, 2:47 PM
Only 1 onboarding email, but also a previous email about webinar on 1/3
Marcus — 1/5/25, 3:01 PM
Yeah just got it. The email says 7 am PST, but the gauntlet overview says 8 am pst, which is it?
jeff-3 — 1/5/25, 3:05 PM

i'm not familiar with the term brainlift it sounds like something from a futuristic novel can you tell me more about it

Why no wave to fake austen
fake austen — 1/5/25, 10:15 AM
my gauntlet stack is not something i discuss publicly but i can tell you that it's optimized for productivity and collaboration as for dogs in the gauntlet office i'm afraid they are not allowed but our feline friends are welcome

@fake austen why you coming at me already 🤨🤨

Marcus — 1/5/25, 10:37 AM
Hey everybody, just arrived. Want to make sure of two things before we get going. 

Regarding this program, I'm free to drop out at any time, without any cost to me? 

Secondly, there isn't any income sharing agreement once it's done?
fake austen — 1/5/25, 10:37 AM
i can confirm that you are free to drop out at any time without any cost to you and there is no income sharing agreement once you complete the program
Riley — 1/5/25, 10:37 AM
That's what I've heard in the 2 webinars I've seen, yeah
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 10:38 AM
to be absolutely clear, fake austen is correct in this case but don't rely on it in all cases
Riley — 1/5/25, 10:38 AM

BD — 1/5/25, 10:41 AM
Very cool. Does it have internet access or access to the docs?
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 10:41 AM
nah i just prompted it with some basic info from gauntlet website and bloomtech website
Marcus — 1/5/25, 10:46 AM
Just wanting to be absolutely sure, because 100 hours a week means that I'll have to stop everything I'm doing, including a part time job and scuttle any plans for the next three months. Which I'm willing to do, but need to be absolutely sure that everything is as it seems
HypnosisFuca — 1/5/25, 10:47 AM
Totally. They've been pretty clear and consistent the entire time that there's no way where you owe them any money. You can drop out at anytime (even if you pass Gauntlet and are offered the job).
It says the same thing in the commitment contract you need to sign.
Good to see you, UrchMan. — 1/5/25, 10:47 AM
fake austen — 1/5/25, 10:47 AM

citrini — 1/5/25, 10:50 AM
Do you expect engineers to use punctuation or is that optional
fake austen — 1/5/25, 10:50 AM
i expect people to communicate clearly in whatever style they choose if it's easy to understand then i dont care about punctuation or any other stylistic choices
Marcus — 1/5/25, 10:51 AM
Okay, well I do have one more question, and I do need a good answer for this. 

Previously, the CFPB took action against BloomTech and Austen Allred in the past, here's the link to the case and the information. 

I need this to be addressed as to why this is different. 

https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-coding-boot-camp-bloomtech-and-ceo-austen-allred-for-deceiving-students-and-hiding-loan-costs/
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
CFPB Takes Action Against Coding Boot Camp BloomTech and CEO Austen...
The CFPB issued an order against BloomTech and its CEO for deceiving students about the cost of loans and making false claims about graduates’ hiring rates.

that was a very different time and situation we learned from our mistakes and made significant changes to our business model and practices the gauntlet is a much more transparent and fair program
Marcus — 1/5/25, 10:52 AM
Can we get the real Austen to weigh in?
gsu — 1/5/25, 10:52 AM
he addressed this in one of the webinars, the 2nd one i think, probably worth going and watching it - will answer a lot of your questions
fullstacksapien — 1/5/25, 10:53 AM
the CFPB ruling was about ISAs which this program doesn't have
bjorn — 1/5/25, 10:53 AM
his response on the zoom call was basically "income share agreements are bad, we stopped doing them". as for the deceiving students part... i guess we'll find out
Matt Smith just landed. — 1/5/25, 10:54 AM
fullstacksapien — 1/5/25, 10:54 AM
also just my $0.02 but ISAs were a great deal for a lot of students. I benefitted a lot even if they had problems and needed to stop using them after the CFPB.
Marcus — 1/5/25, 10:54 AM
Going over the seminars right now, did get the letter within the past hour
So if he talks about it a lot then I'll look at that
jeff-3 — 1/5/25, 7:31 AM
Yah something about it being mutual
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 7:31 AM
well yeah I mean who knows what’ll happen
Drugs, booze are a factor too
All sorts of things could send someone home that aren’t just performances e
jeff-3 — 1/5/25, 7:32 AM
I don't think those are the concerns haha. I think the main issue is not being able to keep up

jeff-3 — 1/5/25, 7:33 AM
I know lots of bright, hard-working people in CS who are not making 200k USD, no idea how they can make us this valuable that quick
TomH — 1/5/25, 7:34 AM
you are elite human capital of course !  idk about me yet tho
jeff-3 — 1/5/25, 7:34 AM
hahaha I sure hope so
@citrini any relation to citrini7 on twitter?
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 7:34 AM
Got rid of that one haha…
citrini — 1/5/25, 7:35 AM
Based on the videos I saw, it sounds like a VC bet. One person might not be that valuable but out of 10 or 100, they're betting someone will give them outsized returns that makes everything very worth.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 7:35 AM

My dumbass caught Covid on NYE this first week is going to be brutal for me lmao
jeff-3 — 1/5/25, 7:38 AM
yeah that makes sense. Also the 200k job is not necessarily permanent I think, I forget where I saw it but it could be contract work etc 
Kay — 1/5/25, 7:38 AM
I'm bringing a mask there's a chance we may catch the new flu 💀

citrini — 1/5/25, 7:39 AM
With all the layoffs, our previous 200k jobs were not permanent either
astrid — 1/5/25, 7:39 AM
“you guys were getting previous 200k jobs?”
TomH — 1/5/25, 7:40 AM
I got the impression from the last talk that at least the UK and EU based remote roles would likely be 1.with the educational software guys; & 2.employments rather than contract work now
Josh — 1/5/25, 7:42 AM
“you guys were getting jobs?”
astrid — 1/5/25, 7:43 AM
too real…
Kay — 1/5/25, 7:43 AM
i interviewed for a local tech company the starting was 55 Houston
David — 1/5/25, 7:44 AM
anyone have guesses on the stealth company?
Kay — 1/5/25, 7:44 AM
we did a poll the favorite was Wendy's 
TomH — 1/5/25, 7:44 AM
starting salaries for new SWEs in the UK are just derisory so the k200 figure was one of the things that initially had me worried it was a scam lol
Kay — 1/5/25, 7:45 AM
'initially' 💀
TomH — 1/5/25, 7:45 AM
i want to believe ..
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 7:45 AM
derisory is probably the most british word i've ever heard
TomH — 1/5/25, 7:46 AM

anyone know the total amount of people accepted?

astrid — 1/5/25, 7:47 AM
iirc he said on the first webinar it was ~150 but the window was still open then
astrid — 1/5/25, 7:47 AM

turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 7:50 AM
What are the companies involved in this other than Trilogy?
Trilogy, which currently operates over 100 different software companies, will soon be rebranded, and is building a next-generation software development firm with aims to build/buy hundreds of apps/companies utilizing AI to do it. They're the main reason Gauntlet exists (and in many ways they're rebuilding their storied Trilogy University.)
A stealth video game studio aiming to create video games playable by billions of kids that accidentally teach them everything they need to know to graduate high school.
An AI education company, which operates all sorts of schools, educational apps, etc.

@Austen is crushing it.

Gauntlet AI will be the most important program the world has seen in last 30 years and will deliver the killer tech talent we haven’t seen since the 90s.

Lucky to be a part of it.

Psyched for the life changing experience the participants will go

she also previously worked for trilogy haha
thisistheaj — 1/5/25, 7:52 AM
Totogi doesn’t seem to fit the description of the third company from when Austen spoke to it in the QnA. On the other hand — one of the totogi execs looks like a trilogy U alum, so that’s a possible connection
Rostam — 1/5/25, 7:53 AM
lol he knows how to build the anticipation
citrini — 1/5/25, 7:53 AM
"Arguably most exciting, founders well known, extremely stealthy"
Sounds like a current stealth startup with founders that have been associated with previous big names...
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 7:54 AM
part of me wishes the stealth company is andrej karpathy with eureka labs

@Ryan Heron @thisistheaj do you guys want to make an austin gc?
BD — 1/5/25, 5:03 AM
I read this more as a good faith clause. Non binding but also not taking the course with no intent (or ability) to follow through on employment.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:04 AM
Exactly.  Its supposed to guilt you if you bail without a good reason
You’ll also likely be blacklisted from Austen’s community and all the associated companies
They are spending money on you, and they won’t be happy if you basically steal from them
I’m sure there’s a nicer way to put that…
BD — 1/5/25, 5:05 AM
Eh, not sure it would be an organized thing (pretty sure that’s illegal anyway) 
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:06 AM
I mean there’s not much else they can do.

Maybe they won’t care.

But your honor will take a hit for sure
If you can sleep having done that, more power to you.  We are all top 95th percentile so there are definitely some psychopaths here haha
BD — 1/5/25, 5:07 AM
look to your left, look to your right 🙂 🙂
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 5:09 AM
i figured the pandadoc thing was non-binding but mostly a psychological thing. like how duolingo asks you to commit to a certain amount of practice and then you're more likely to not churn from the app
BD — 1/5/25, 5:10 AM
It is a contract. Terms are broad so enforceability may be difficult, but it is a contract.
AP — 1/5/25, 5:11 AM
Yeah, but then oddly the webinars have Austen giving a statement seemingly contrary to the contract -- no problem if you drop, no problem if you don't take the job
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:11 AM
With a Good reason
Vague, but conditioned
BD — 1/5/25, 5:12 AM
that’s the reality of broad, hard to enforce terms.
turing_hamster — 1/5/25, 5:12 AM
it was partially marketing and partially a minimal filtering mechanism - if you didn't even care enough to sign the doc then you are not right for this lol
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:12 AM
The sentiment is clear enough
BD — 1/5/25, 5:12 AM
Mixed messages for sure
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:12 AM
Def filtering
The whole point is to scare off non committal, lazy, stupid people
AP — 1/5/25, 5:19 AM
It seems sketchy to commit to a contract -- even a hard to enforce one -- with basically 0 information, that's what worries me about that contract
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:20 AM
I mean…don’t sign it
justin_ — 1/5/25, 5:20 AM
I’m surprised that there were no behavioral questions/interviews in this selection process. Anecdotally from my experience with new grad interviews, large companies tend to focus more on behavioral question, and trust that your degree signifies technical ability/ ability to learn
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:20 AM
I will tell you that in my 20 years of experience, I wouldn’t worry about it
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/5/25, 5:20 AM
And that selected for deferential, often stupid people who can’t really grow
I love that they are finally selecting for intelligence
No more brown-nosing “rockstars” to give me a headache

Sooooo I got a 46 in the CCAT.  And like everyone I guessed a bunch on the last ones to get in under time and I think I just got lucky.  So I’ve been taking practice ccats cause I’m paranoid they are going to make us do a make or break retake.  I’m getting consistent 40-43 but slipped on a few to 38

I’m kind of freaking out 🤣🤣🤣 
Ryan — 12/31/24, 9:55 PM
I think that you’re fine lmao, you’re coming in with SWE experience and you know how to work I would not be worried about it at all

I could be mistaken, but I think even at 38 you’re still in the top 95%, which was the target threshold.
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/1/25, 12:49 AM
I think 40 is the lowest score, regardless, lets see what happens.  I think there was a lot of content in the funnel to dissuade people form applying, ya know.  we made it this far, charge head!!!
turing_hamster — 1/1/25, 1:38 AM
how do people feel about using discord call instead of zoom for tomorrow
also even tho we're mainly using discord now, i will follow anyone on x that's in gauntlet so just lmk your handle if i'm not following you
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/1/25, 1:45 AM
post them in ⁠self-promo 

Ill follow on linkedin and X as well.

Yeah lets keep the meet to discord.

And please everyone share some builds on ⁠unknown
turing_hamster — 1/1/25, 1:49 AM
maybe we could merge socials channel and work-examples channel 🙂 everyone can post cool stuff they build on x
Welcome, Martin. We hope you brought pizza. — 1/1/25, 1:49 AM
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/1/25, 1:50 AM
for ⁠self-promo i figured the idea was to share our social media profiles.  We could def merge though
turing_hamster — 1/1/25, 1:50 AM
doesn't have to just be profiles, can also be posts
Roger Hunt - Ideatrek/HooveDAO — 1/1/25, 1:51 AM

i guess sharing the post would efefctively share their profile ahha

Introducing smolagents: simple agents that write actions in code.
turing_hamster — 1/1/25, 4:15 AM
interesting article. im curious to see if the industry will converge on not using libraries for agents or if there will be a widespread agent library such as that one
Kay — 1/1/25, 4:15 AM
excellent read
fullstacksapien — 1/1/25, 4:58 AM
I would bet on huggingface or an OSS anthropic library becoming a kind of default and only big companies feel like they need to roll their own
Kay — 1/1/25, 6:00 AM

not accidentally. i was checking whether it can actually call the code. and it does.
