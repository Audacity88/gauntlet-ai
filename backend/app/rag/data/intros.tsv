Name: Dai
Intro Message: Hi All 👋
    A biologist by training but since teaching myself to code I’ve mostly done backend stuff for deep-tech-ish startups. My first ever language was haskell so naturally it was a gateway drug to category theory research in which I detoured, but that way lies madness 👹
    These days I spend most of my time wrangling CUDA kernels for my doomed HCI garage-startup.
    I’ve done a lot of volunteer teaching/admissions and cofounded a research accelerator nonprofit so  How To Actually Do Education Well™ is always on my mind and am excited to see how Gauntlet turns out.
If you have strong opinions about Friston I’d love to talk 😁
Years of experience: 6?
SWE: yes
Skills: 
    -Proficient:: C++/CUDA, Rust, Haskell, Agda 
    -Intermediate: Fullstack stuff ~ Python, Typescript, GraphQL, SQL
    -Beginner: I have approximate knowledge of many things
    -Want to learn: to remember everyone’s name 😖
More seriously,: I was doing non-dev stuff when AI took off, and now as a “traditional” dev, am painfully aware of how much more efficient I could be
David — 1/5/25, 5:22 AM
Hello! I'm David. I am a college dropout, and currently work in asset protection in retail. I live in Fort Worth, Texas and have all my life besides my time at Texas A&M. There, I studied political, which I am still interested in. Recently, I have been using LLMs like Claude to introduce myself to the world of AI and programming more broadly. I've been learning python using boot.dev, and am liking it so far!A few months ago, I couldn't print hello world to the console, but here we are. I think AI is changing the world, and making it possible for people like me to have opportunities like these. Safe to say I'm excited.

I'm Terry! 28, Boston. Majored in CS; quit my first software dev job a year in to become a decently successful selfpub author; eventually wanted something different; dabbled in programming again recently and was impressed by how dang easy it was to e.g. generate AI video transcriptions and so on; saw this program and decided to take a crack at it. At this point I think I'd rather work on building the future than writing about it, and the former would probably help with the latter in any case. 😄 Nice to meet you all!

Hey all. I'm Steve, I'm 39 from SoCal. Been working on my journalism startup for a while but I'm looking to get back into a team setting for the next couple of years, network a bunch, try to have a really good time doing it. I decided to try this instead of hiking the PCT for a second year (I've got my permit so it's still a backup plan). I do eventually want to get back into startups but I just need a change for now. I was in Austin for the eclipse festival and I like the city.

Intro Message: Hi, everybody! I'm Rob. I'm 41 and living in the SF Bay Area, California.  My background is in Mechanical Engineering, Product Development and Product Management.  If I'm an expert in anything, it's probably in 3D CAD for mechanical product design.  As for coding, I'm somewhat a jack of all trades, as I've been programming in some form or other for a long time, but never as a dedicated software engineer in any particular discipline.  Instead I have done a bunch of disparate projects involving coding along the way.  I've built website front- and back-ends, programs to calibrate machines on assembly lines, firmware functions to run electro-mechanical devices, iOS apps, prototype devices using e.g. Arduino boards, a bunch of scripts and macros to automate all kinds of things, etc., etc.

I've been keeping an eye out for a good opportunity to make a career leap to one of the cutting-edge areas of tech that have been blowing up the last couple of years, and boy did the Gauntlet AI announcement resonate with me!  I'm excited to get to work with all of you who decided to officially start the program!

edgineer — 1/6/25, 1:18 AM
Kriss here, from Massachusetts. Just about two years ago I joined a full stack dev bootcamp in Boston that had a good, long reputation... which shut down last year because basically no early career devs were getting hired anymore. This was just a GPT-4 became available and there were huge questions about the future of coding education and junior roles. Still, I loved it there, built React applications with express backend, testing using cypress/jest.

Before that, I went to UMass for computer engineering, was in the USAF, and helped to start up a factory. Jack of all trades; I like to fix things and learn skills; not at all excited by job hunting, and I'm also not much of a designer, I prefer backend and embedded. I've never actually had a job specifically in tech.

Here's hoping we're actually the first wave of the next generation of builders!
Jsopkin — 1/6/25, 1:36 AM
Hi everyone, I'm James, 27 years old from Chicago. I joined lambda's data science program and graduated in 2021. Shortly after that I got a job as a data engineer and then a job as a solutions engineer at a tech startup. I got laid off last year and the job search has been tough so I decided to give gauntlet a try.

My background includes a degree in communication from UIUC with a handful of internships including one in technical writing. Then I have a data science bootcamp and a couple of aws certs. I'm self taught in a few areas and I started getting into ai a few months ago. I've been building ai agents and running image and video generation workflows with comfy ui. 

Nice to meet y'all

Hi all, my name is Eli and this scares the ever-living crap out of me but passing up on this scares me more. I am 22 years old and graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Engineering. For the last year and a half I have been getting my Master’s part time while working in support for a company that provides hardware and software for rapid control prototyping and simulation/validation for electric control units (mainly automotive). The tech is pretty cool and you have to have hardware/software understanding to work with our tools, but I was not building anything myself and there was a slim chance I would ever get the chance to. Quick shoutout to my wonderful fiancé that I will be marrying in May and gave me the clear to quit my job + throw all the wedding panning on her. My hobbies are exercising (lifting, swimming, biking, running), X, and hanging with family.

Cool, I'm a chess player as well. I was actually doing some research because I want to try building a (simplified) chess engine from scratch. If you're interested, we could play some time. I have a humble rating of 1500 rapid.

Let's do it. I haven't played in awhile, but IIRC I'm ~1700 
sterling — 1/3/25, 12:09 PM
I go to a sim racing place nearby, but the setups look like this except with another monitor on each side. I think they use iracing... but it's been a long time since I asked about it

Behnam — 1/4/25, 6:44 AM
Name: Behnam Arzaghi

Intro Message: Hi hi. Lovely to meet you all, excited to learn together. I grew up in West Texas. Studied classical violin and music composition from a pretty early age and spent part of my undergrad in LA at a music conservatory pursuing the same. Eventually ended up getting degrees in Computer Science and Physics at a small liberal arts school in the bay but decided not to enter the industry after graduating. 

I’ve been living in Austin TX since 2017. I teach yoga classes at one of the local climbing gyms (would love to put together a group climb for us once we’re all in town) and private violin lessons at one of the local high schools. I’ve been interested in meditation/buddhism for quite a few years now, have attended a few silent meditation retreats and love to host group sits/events/dinners at my home when I can (might have to do it in shifts, but would love to have you all over for dinner at some point once we’re in Austin!). My main interest in AI-based software development is to (I hope 🙃) contribute to making tech that is less invasive and more value-aligned so that we can spend more time doing the things we enjoy with the people we love. 

Age: 31

Years of experience: SWE: 0

Skills: Re: coding, I’m pretty rusty so likely won’t be the person to go to with questions–But! If you want to talk about different contemplative traditions/meditation techniques or have conversations about classical music esoterica, my god will I talk your ear off.
